## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
<h3>Predictive Farming Calender</h3>
The proposed solution is the creation of a Predictive Farming Calendar, an AI-driven advisory tool designed to act as a personalized farming guide for every small and marginal farmer. Unlike generic advisories, this calendar will be dynamic and real-time, adjusting recommendations based on soil conditions, weather forecasts, crop history, and local farming practices. It will provide step-by-step guidance on critical decisions such as the right time to sow seeds, apply irrigation, use fertilizers, manage pests, and harvest crops for maximum yield. The platform will be available in multiple regional languages, with both text and voice support, ensuring accessibility even for farmers with limited literacy or smartphone experience. To make it more practical, the system will also include alert notifications (e.g., “rain expected tomorrow – postpone irrigation”) that can help farmers avoid losses and save resources. Farmers will be able to input basic details like crop type and sowing date once, and the system will generate a personalized season-long calendar that updates automatically as new data (weather, pest outbreaks, etc.) becomes available. By combining AI predictions with localized agricultural knowledge, the solution empowers farmers to move from guesswork to data-driven decisions in their daily practices.

Additionally, the calendar will serve as a knowledge transfer tool, allowing even first-time farmers to follow structured and proven methods rather than relying on trial and error. The predictive model will also consider socio-economic constraints, such as availability of water, seeds, or fertilizers in the region, making the advice more realistic and actionable. In the long run, this tool can integrate with market data systems, advising farmers not just on when to grow but also when and where to sell their produce for maximum profitability. The calendar’s adaptability makes it suitable for diverse crops and regions, from rainfed villages to irrigated farmlands. Ultimately, the predictive farming calendar acts like a “Google Calendar for Farming”, a digital assistant that not only tells farmers what to do and when to do it but also helps them make smarter, sustainable, and more profitable decisions year after year.

## Technical Approach
The technical approach involves integrating multiple data sources and AI models to deliver accurate and localized farming predictions. Weather APIs will provide real-time and forecasted climatic data, while soil health records and crop history will be collected via farmer inputs or government/NGO databases. A machine learning model will analyze these data points to predict optimal farming actions for each stage of crop growth. Natural Language Processing (NLP) will enable the calendar to deliver recommendations in multiple Indian languages, with both text and voice support. The app will also include image recognition features so farmers can upload crop images for detecting pests and diseases, which will further refine the calendar recommendations. Lightweight mobile-friendly design and offline caching will ensure usability in rural areas with low internet connectivity. The backend system will continuously learn from farmer feedback and outcomes to improve future predictions. Security and privacy measures will be applied so that farmer data is protected and used ethically. This approach ensures the solution is not only technologically advanced but also practical for rural realities.

## Feasibility and Viability
The Predictive Farming Calendar is highly feasible due to the availability of existing data infrastructure, mobile penetration, and government initiatives supporting digital agriculture. In India, over 75% of rural households now have access to mobile phones, making app-based and SMS/voice-based services realistic. Partnerships with agricultural universities, government agencies, and NGOs can provide initial datasets for soil and crop conditions. The app can start with a pilot in one or two regions, focusing on common crops like paddy, wheat, or maize, and then scale nationwide. Viability is also strengthened by the low-cost nature of deployment, since the system can operate on existing APIs and AI models without requiring expensive physical infrastructure. Farmers could access the service for free under government subsidy programs, or through a freemium model where advanced features like market price predictions or premium advisory come at a small fee. Because it reduces input waste and increases yields, farmers will see direct financial benefits, ensuring adoption and willingness to engage. The scalability across different regions and crops makes it a sustainable long-term solution.
